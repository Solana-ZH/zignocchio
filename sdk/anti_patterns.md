# Common Anti-Patterns in Solana + Zig

This document lists common mistakes that AI code agents make when writing Solana programs in Zig, and how to fix them using Zignocchio.

## 1. Taking the address of a module-scope constant

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
pub const SYSTEM_PROGRAM_ID: sdk.Pubkey = .{0} ** 32;

if (!sdk.pubkeyEq(account.owner(), &SYSTEM_PROGRAM_ID)) {
    return error.IncorrectProgramId;
}
```

**Why it's wrong**
Zig 0.16's BPF backend may place module-scope constants at invalid low addresses (e.g. `0x0`). Passing their address to syscalls or CPI causes an `Access violation in unknown section` at runtime.

**Fix**
```zig
var system_program_id: sdk.Pubkey = .{0} ** 32;
if (!sdk.pubkeyEq(account.owner(), &system_program_id)) {
    return error.IncorrectProgramId;
}
```

**Zignocchio helper**
`sdk.system.getSystemProgramId(&out)` already follows this pattern.

## 2. Forgetting the signer check

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
fn withdraw(accounts: []sdk.AccountInfo) sdk.ProgramResult {
    const user = accounts[0];
    // No signer check!
    user.lamports -= amount;
}
```

**Why it's wrong**
Anyone can pass any account in the `accounts` array. Without `assert_signer`, an attacker can execute privileged instructions on behalf of another user.

**Fix**
```zig
try sdk.guard.assert_signer(user);
```

---

## 3. Forgetting the owner check

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
const data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
// No owner check!
data.value[0] = 1;
```

**Why it's wrong**
An attacker can create an account with the same data layout but owned by a different program. Your program would then mutate someone else's state.

**Fix**
```zig
try sdk.guard.assert_owner(account, program_id);
const data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
defer data.release();
data.value[0] = 1;
```

---

## 4. Using the wrong PDA seeds

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
const seeds = &[_][]const u8{ "vault" };
var vault_key: sdk.Pubkey = undefined;
var bump: u8 = undefined;
try sdk.findProgramAddress(seeds, program_id, &vault_key, &bump);
// Later, verify using different seeds
```

**Why it's wrong**
If the seeds used to derive the PDA don't match the seeds used to verify it, funds can be sent to or controlled by the wrong address.

**Fix**
```zig
const seeds = &[_][]const u8{ "vault", &owner_key };
try sdk.guard.assert_pda(vault_account, seeds, program_id, bump);
```

---

## 5. Skipping the discriminator check

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
const MyAccount = extern struct { value: u64 };
const data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
var typed = @as(*MyAccount, @ptrCast(@alignCast(data.value.ptr)));
```

**Why it's wrong**
Without a discriminator, you might deserialize an `OwnerAccount` as a `UserAccount`, leading to type confusion and arbitrary state mutations.

**Fix**
```zig
const MyAccount = extern struct {
    pub const DISCRIMINATOR: u8 = 0xAB;
    discriminator: u8,
    value: u64,
};
const Schema = sdk.schema.AccountSchema(MyAccount);
try Schema.validate(account);
var ref: sdk.RefMut([]u8) = undefined;
try Schema.from_bytes(account, &ref);
defer ref.release();
var typed = Schema.from_bytes_unchecked(ref.value);
```

---

## 6. Double mutable borrow

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
var data1 = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
var data2 = try account.tryBorrowMutData(); // Panic!
```

**Why it's wrong**
Solana's borrow state machine only allows one mutable borrow at a time. The second `tryBorrowMutData` will return `error.AccountBorrowFailed` at runtime.

**Fix**
```zig
var data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
defer data.release();
data.value[0] = 1;
// All mutations done before release
```

---

## 7. Calling CPI while holding an active borrow

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
var data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
// borrow is still active
try sdk.invoke(&instruction, accounts); // CPI may fail!
data.release();
```

**Why it's wrong**
The CPI target may also try to borrow the same account, causing `AccountBorrowFailed`.

**Fix**
```zig
var data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
data.value[0] = 1;
data.release(); // ✅ release before CPI
try sdk.invoke(&instruction, accounts);
```

---

## 8. Creating a non-rent-exempt account

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
// Creating an account with 0 lamports
```

**Why it's wrong**
On Solana, all new accounts must be rent exempt. A rent-paying account can be drained by the rent collector and effectively deleted.

**Fix**
```zig
const rent_exempt_min = sdk.system.getRentExemptMinimum(data_len);
try sdk.guard.assert_rent_exempt(lamports, data_len);
```

**Note**: `sdk.guard.assert_rent_exempt` uses a conservative approximation. For production programs, verify against the current rent epoch.

---

## 9. Overwriting an already initialized account

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
const data = account.borrowMutDataUnchecked();
data[0] = 1; // No check if account already has state!
```

**Why it's wrong**
Re-initializing an account that already holds state destroys existing data and can lead to double-initialization bugs or fund loss.

**Fix**
```zig
try sdk.guard.assert_uninitialized(try account.borrowDataUnchecked());
// Safe to initialize now
```

---

## 10. Using an uninitialized account

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
const data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
// data is all zeros, but we treat it as a valid struct
var state = @as(*MyAccount, @ptrCast(@alignCast(data.value.ptr)));
```

**Why it's wrong**
An uninitialized account contains all zeros. Treating it as a valid typed account leads to zero-value assumptions and potential exploits.

**Fix**
```zig
try sdk.guard.assert_initialized(data.value);
```

---

## 11. Passing the same account twice

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
// source and destination are the same account index
try sdk.system.transfer(from, to, amount);
```

**Why it's wrong**
Many instructions require distinct accounts (e.g., swap, transfer). Passing the same account can create self-referential state mutations or bypass intended invariants.

**Fix**
```zig
try sdk.guard.assert_keys_not_equal(from, to);
try sdk.system.transfer(from, to, amount);
```

---

## 12. Trusting an unverified program ID

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
// Calling CPI to an account that might not be the expected program
try sdk.invoke(&instruction, accounts);
```

**Why it's wrong**
An attacker can substitute any program account in the accounts array. Your program may invoke malicious code.

**Fix**
```zig
try sdk.guard.assert_program_id(target_program.key(), &EXPECTED_PROGRAM_ID);
try sdk.guard.assert_executable(target_program);
try sdk.invoke(&instruction, accounts);
```

---

## 13. Assuming an account is immutable when it is writable

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
const config = accounts[1];
// No immutability check — but config is passed as writable
```

**Why it's wrong**
If an account that should remain unchanged is passed as writable, a compromised signer or buggy client can mutate it unexpectedly.

**Fix**
```zig
try sdk.guard.assert_immutable(config);
```

---

## 14. Deserializing account data without checking length

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
const data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
var state = @as(*MyAccount, @ptrCast(@alignCast(data.value.ptr)));
// MyAccount might be larger than data.value.len
```

**Why it's wrong**
If the account data is smaller than the expected struct, the pointer cast reads past the buffer boundary, causing undefined behavior.

**Fix**
```zig
try sdk.guard.assert_min_data_len(account, @sizeOf(MyAccount));
const data = try account.tryBorrowMutData();
var state = @as(*MyAccount, @ptrCast(@alignCast(data.value.ptr)));
```

---

## 15. Trusting a token account without verifying its owner

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
// Assuming any account passed as 'token_account' is a valid SPL token account
const token_account = accounts[0];
try sdk.token.transfer.transfer(token_account, destination, authority, amount);
```

**Why it's wrong**
An attacker can pass a fake account that isn't owned by the Token Program. The CPI will fail, but more importantly, any pre-transfer balance checks or validations on that account will operate on attacker-controlled data.

**Fix**
```zig
var token_program_id: sdk.Pubkey = undefined;
sdk.token.getTokenProgramId(&token_program_id);
try sdk.guard.assert_owner(token_account, &token_program_id);
try sdk.token.transfer.transfer(token_account, destination, authority, amount);
```

---

## 16. Using regular transfer when the authority is a PDA

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
// vault_token_account is a PDA and should sign, but we use regular transfer
try sdk.token.transfer.transfer(vault_token_account, user_token_account, vault_token_account, amount);
```

**Why it's wrong**
Regular `transfer` requires the authority to be a transaction signer. If the authority is a PDA owned by your program, it cannot sign transactions directly. The CPI will fail with `MissingRequiredSignature`.

**Fix**
```zig
const signer_seeds = &[_][]const u8{ "vault", &owner_key, &[_]u8{bump} };
try sdk.token.transfer.transferSigned(
    vault_token_account,
    user_token_account,
    vault_token_account,
    amount,
    signer_seeds,
);
```

---

## 17. Creating an ATA without verifying the address

**Anti-pattern**
```zig
const ata = accounts[1];
try sdk.token.ata.createAssociatedTokenAccount(payer, ata, owner, mint, system_program, token_program);
```

**Why it's wrong**
A malicious client could pass any account as the ATA. If you don't verify it's the correct PDA derived from the owner and mint, you might create or fund the wrong account.

**Fix**
```zig
var expected_ata: sdk.Pubkey = undefined;
try sdk.token.ata.getAssociatedTokenAddress(mint.key(), owner.key(), &expected_ata);
if (!sdk.pubkeyEq(ata.key(), &expected_ata)) {
    return error.InvalidAccountData;
}
try sdk.token.ata.createAssociatedTokenAccount(payer, ata, owner, mint, system_program, token_program);
```
